## Abstract

Our research will measure how the portability of an application is impacted by decisions made early in the software lifecycle when native cloud provider APIs are used. We will demonstrate how efforts to leverage scalable, reproducable solutions like boto and libcloud are advantageous. We will derive reproducable code using Swagger and Python to show how libraries like boto and libcloud can be used to migrate an application from one cloud provider to another with a measurable reduction in human error and with less time to execute. Additionally, we will leverage Swagger to develop RESTful APIs to further improve the gains. We will capture the results of the research, share the derived code and conclude how the research can be applied to existing and new development efforts intending to leverage cloud providers.

## Introduction

Cloud portability is a growing area of research due to the increased profiliferation of cloud providers. Each provider has unique APIs and tools to their cloud environments which can disincentivize portability as it influences a consumer to stay with their existing solution provider. Efforts to standardize cloud portability have made progress yet participation by cloud providers is constrained due to the competitive nature in the space. Each cloud provider is looking to retain their userbase and there is also a desire by each provider to become the de facto standard by being the market leader. To fill the gap, solutions like Apache libcloud and boto have delivered an abstraction solution to developers to design applications that are easy to port.

Developers are already confronted with a lack of transparency on which cloud provider is optimal for the long-term sustainability of their application. Additionally, attempts to abstract cloud providers has been helpful yet the non-standardization still potentially locks you into solutions provided by Apache or communities like boto. We will deliver a continuation of that abstraction concept with REST to extend libcloud and boto. By leveraging REST, we intend to introduce a standardized implementation that leverages cloud portability libraries to manage the diversity of cloud applications. A high-level abstract of our final concept is below.

## Scope of work
- Value Hypothesis
- Cycle time metrics on porting a solution without boto/libcloud
- Lead time metrics on use of RESTful APIs compared to command line usage
- RESTful API
  - Swagger development to design/build API services for UI
  - Python development to leverage boto/libcloud
  - Evidence of success porting a solution from/to AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- Comparison of porting solution manually to libcloud/boto by command line
- Comparison of porting solution with libcloud/boto by commandline to RESTful API solution
- Conclusion

## Special Consideration to Project Format
- Swagger API documentation
- Comparison of command line tools to Python libraries libcloud and boto
- Background on TOSCA
